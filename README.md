# Bellabeat Case Study
a capstone project for Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program

## Background
In this case study, you will perform data analysis for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. You will analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. Your analysis will help guide future marketing strategies for your team. Along the way, you will perform numerous real-world tasks of a junior data analyst by following the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. By the time you are done, you will have a portfolio-ready case study to help you demonstrate your knowledge and skills to potential employers!

A detailed case study packet is saved in the Business Ask folder.

To facilitate the planning stage of this project, I put together [this mind map](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVL_Uxt_4=/?share_link_id=308983498196) based on the guides in the packet and some action plans I jotted down as I read the requirements.

Now I am starting this case study by following the steps of the data analysis process: **ask**, **prepare**, **process**, **analyze**, **share**, and **act**. So this document will follow the same structure.

## Ask
**Business Ask**: Or the purpose statement of this study is, to identify key characteristics of users using wearable fitness tracker, and then use these insights to guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

**Stakeholders**: The findings and recommendations will be shared with Bellabeat's executive team, among whom are Ur≈°ka Sr≈°en, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer, and Sando Mur, Mathematician and cofounder. In addition, I will also collaborate and share results with the marketing analytics team, which includes a team of data experts and analysts just like myself.

## Prepare
Ur≈°ka has pointed me to a dataset of FitBit tracker. Upon inspection, this dataset contains usage data of 30 individual users. The number of observations is on the low side, barely making the cut to qualify it as a sample good enough to be representative of the user space of smart device market. [This link](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/central-limit-theorem/#:~:text=The%20central%20limit%20theorem%20states%20that%20the%20sampling%20distribution%20of,size%20is%20n%20%E2%89%A5%2030.) provides a brief explanation of why a sample size of greater than 30 is desirable.

I tried searching in [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/search/all), and [Google](https://www.google.com/). The only dataset other than the abovementioned FitBit data is one that records activity data of one single Redmi Fuel Band user over the past three years. While the data appear to be well maintained, and it is very applaudable that this individual is willing to share their data, I decide not to include it because it adds very little incremental value to our FitBit dataset. I was not surprised by how scarce data could be, when it comes to information related to health and activity, since people are very vigilent about their privacy. We can build on this thought when Bellabeat collects and uses user data in the future.

Moving on, let's take a closer look to the FitBit dataset. [This dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) is available on Kaggle, or alternatively [here](https://zenodo.org/records/53894#.YMoUpnVKiP9) on Zenodo. These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors and/or preferences. 

Here is my evaluation regarding how the data fare as good data, on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the best):
* **Reliable - 8**: Activity data are collected by the FitBit device, so I consider it quite reliable as opposed to be from a self-report survey. However, users may not wear the tracker 24/7, so activities such as steps and sleep time may be under-reprensented.
* **Original - 10**: The data is collected through FitBit trackers by user who consented to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
* **Comprehensive - 8**: The data included is directly governed by what the tracker is able to track, so I think it is pretty good in terms of comprehensiveness, but not ideal. For example, if we want to raise awareness about [obesity](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight), the best way to evaluate a person is by their BMI. However, neither weight nor height can be measured by a fitness tracker. In this dataset, some weight data are available if and only if user logs them in the app.
* **Current - 1**: Data include activity recorded from March to April of 2016, which is more than 8 years ago. Generational trends and user behavior probably have changed by now, so this dataset fares poorly on this scale, and may not provide useful business insights today.
* **Cited - 10**: Data is collected by Julia E Brinton, Mike D Keating, Alexa M Ortiz, Kelly R Evenson, Robert D Furberg in [this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28450274/).

Data files are collected over 2 periods of time: one from Mar 12, 2016 to Apr 11, 2016, and the other from Apr 12, 2016 to May 12, 2016. But data files across periods do not necessarily align. If the same data tables exist for both time periods, I can simply stack them (when Col 3 and 4 are both "Yes" in the following table).
