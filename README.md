# Bellabeat Case Study
a capstone project for Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program

## Background
In this case study, you will perform data analysis for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. You will analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. Your analysis will help guide future marketing strategies for your team. Along the way, you will perform numerous real-world tasks of a junior data analyst by following the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. By the time you are done, you will have a portfolio-ready case study to help you demonstrate your knowledge and skills to potential employers!
A detailed case study packet is saved in the Business Ask folder.
To facilitate the planning stage of this project, I put together [this mind map](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVL_Uxt_4=/?share_link_id=308983498196) based on the guides in the packet and some action plans I jotted down as I read the requirements.
Now I am starting this case study by following the steps of the data analysis process: **ask**, **prepare**, **process**, **analyze**, **share**, and **act**. So this document will follow the same structure.

## Ask

## Prepare

## Process
